          <h2 style="text-align:center" class="section-heading">Review</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">

          Underrated. If you watched this movie in the cinema, I GUARANTEE you would love it. It's got the Zack Snyder, Scorsese-esque style and grit, but also has a plot and characters you want to follow. Superman (Henry Cavill) and Lois Lane are wonderfully cast, and have surprisingly great chemistry with each other. The supporting cast of General Zod (Michael Shannon, who's a little intense here), Jor-El (Russell Crowe), and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) definitely boosted the star power; I thought Superman's parents (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) were probably the best performances too, and they would have got the win if they'd had a little more effect on the plot. Still, this movie tells a new, captivating story that explores themes of loyalty, choice vs fate, conservatism vs trust - it's not easy. They pull it off remarkably well, and they set up a cinematic universe at the same time. Great job, overall. Fight scenes are also unique because of the direction and colour schemes selected; make them seem a lot more grave and realistic.

          <h3 style="text-align:center">Spoiler Territory</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
          
          That scene at the end was definitely a clincher. Henry Cavill as farmboy Clark was good, as Superman he was great, but that last scene where he smiled as nerdy Clark? Perfect. Christopher Reeves would have said the same. The last fight against Zod may have gotten a little out of hand, but the climax where Clark yells after killing him is really powerful. The story treats the whole ‘superhero' concept very seriously and somehow manages to pull it off relatively well, all things considered. The world engine scene and even the destruction of Krypton were super powerful, but my favourite from this movie would be the one where Jonathan Kent dies and Clark's watching, knowing he could have stopped it. That really sums up his whole struggle, and it's awesome that they went through with that Uncle Ben-type moment.
